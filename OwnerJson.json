	"firstP1" : "After college I took a position in Finance. During that time I discovered the thing I enjoyed the most was process automation. Many people donâ€™t realize that Excel has incorporated a great VBA API. This provides a great learning tool to understand basic programming constructs. My roles allowed me to take this a step further and teach programmatic classes and work with external APIs. This served to highlight one tragic flaw; I did not love my career in Finance.",
	"secondP1" : "After a little over seven years working in Excel, I decided to shift towards a career in Software Development. It might seem like an odd transition, but in retrospect, I think Finance was the perfect segue into programming.  I started studying new languages while networking with many of the great members of the Des Moines development community.",
	"thirdP1" : "Like various elements of this website I pulled myself up by my Bootstraps, and started studying new languages, and networking.  I currently work as a Developer for an agronomic corporation and I am using this as a opportunity to broaden my experience."

	"firstP1" : "Central Iowa has a thriving developer community with a large number of great user groups indicative of a growing market. However, the need for quality craftsmanship is in especially high demand. In 2015, Soaring Leaf Solutions was established to help fill that niche providing technical software solutions.",
	"secondHeader" : "The Middle Years",
	"firstP2" :"As with all ventures, there are initial growing pains. The acquisition of new skill sets should always be of the highest priority in order to remain relevant. Our goal is to develop a broader understanding of technologies and the ways in which they can be used to solve the evolving needs of our customers.",
	"thirdHeader" : "Heretofore known as Now",
	"firstP3" : "Currently, Soaring Leaf Solutions works with the staffing and Agile coaching agency Lean TECHniques. Working alongside such smart and engaging individuals has provided many opportunities to further self-development and participate in community charity events. Each day provides new opportunities to learn, and we at Soaring Leaf Solutions look forward to meeting each new challenge."

"Events" : {
	"firstHeader" : "Upcoming Events",
	"firstP1" : "There are great opportunities in the Des Moines area to provide value to the community.  The 2016 DSM Charity Hack will be taking place March 3, 6:00pm in Downtown Des Moines at the Gravitate Building.  It offers a singular opportunity to help local area non-profit organizations by providing them the tools they need.  10 differing projects are completed over a 48 hour period by people of varied backgrounds and experiences.",
	"firstP2" : "Des Moines has close access to many tech conferences such as The Kansas City Developer Conference (KCDC). The conference runs from June 22 - 24th.  This provides great perspecitve on new trends in the market, differing styles, new tools/frameworks, or new means of problem solving.  It also serves as a great way to network with members within the community.  Highly recommended.",
	"firstP3" : "If you are a fledgling or experienced .Net developer then good news.  There the Iowa Dot Net User Group offers great monthly presetnations on framework changes, Agile Practices, DevOps, the ability to meet and work with recruiters, and much much more.",
	"firstP4" : "There is no lack of Java development in the area.  The Central Iowa Java Users Group offers a chance to connect with other Java developers and to see the diverse efforts in which they are engaged.  There are monthly presentations which give a unique glimpse into the community."

"Home" : {
	"firstHeader" : "What we are working on",
	"firstP1" : "The Internet of Things (IOT) has brought about some amazingly big little revolutions. The shrinking of technology -- both in terms of price paradoxically offset by increases in power -- has made programming more accessible and fun. In my spare time, I have played around with Raspberry Pi and used it to create a sump pump depth sensor and a garage door opener.",
	"secondP1" : "When I first started learning a more Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language I decided to create a calculator app using a scripted approach. Once I was more comfortable and confident with concepts such as Test Drive Development (TDD) and OOP, I created and test drove a second calculator to see how this fundamentally changed my architecture.",
	"thirdP1" : "At the moment, I have been dabbling around in Web Development and played around with Java, Cucumber, and Selenium to generate Integration Tests. I like to think of myself as a man of many interests."
